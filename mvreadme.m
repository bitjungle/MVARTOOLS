% Description:
% ------------
% MVARTOOLS is a collection of Matlab functions for doing multivariate
% data analysis. MVARTOOLS was mainly done as a multivariate analysis
% and Matlab study. The intention by writing this package was not to
% write clever new algorithms or highly optimized code, but to
% understand the linear algebra involved and how to implement this in
% Matlab.
%
% If you need an "industrial strength" multivariate analysis package,
% you'll better have a look at software like "PLS_Toolbox" (Eigenvector),
% "Unscrambler" (Camo) or "Simca" (Umetri).
%
% For a summary of included functions, scripts and data files, see
% the file 'contents.m'.

%
% Todo:
% -----
% * More (and better) demo scripts.
% * Ensure Octave compability (or drop Octave support?).
% * Make Octave plotting routines (or drop Octave support?).
% * Make a GUI for PCA (and other stuff?).
% 
% Bugs:
% -----
% Probably many! A lot of stuff does NOT work in Octave.
