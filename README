MVARTOOLS is a Matlab toolbox for doing multivariate analysis and 
calibration. It is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

MVARTOOLS was made during my M.Sc. thesis work, but was not a part 
of the thesis. I made it just to familiarize myself with Matlab 
(and Octave), and to get a better understanding of the PCA, PCR and 
PLS algorithms. Since 2001, I have not done any development/bug 
fixing on MVARTOOLS. You have been warned!

MVARTOOLS is not a state-of-the-art industrial strength multivariate 
package. If thatâ€™s what you are looking for, I strongly recommend 
PLS_Toolbox.
